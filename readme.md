this is a (poor) cvs import of a project that had lived for many years at:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/dopewarsbb/

i tried to use `git cvsimport` to preserve the history but i was
confused by the top level "modules". the part of my brain that worked
with cvs in the 90s is long gone.

in case this gets easier in the future, i also committed a tgz file of
the complete [rsync backup from
sourceforge](rsync-archive/sourceforge-cvs-rsync-backup.tgz).
